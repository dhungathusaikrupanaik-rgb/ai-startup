The app will have a user authentication system, allowing users to create profiles and track their progress over time. The workout tracking feature will include a database of exercises and workouts, while the nutrition planning feature will provide users with personalized meal plans based on their dietary needs and preferences. The community support feature will allow users to connect with each other, share progress, and participate in discussions. The app will be built using a combination of front-end and back-end technologies, with a focus on user experience and engagement.\n\n## Files to Create\nThe following files will be created:\n* `app.py`: Main application module\n* `models.py`: Database schema and models for users, workouts, and nutrition plans\n* `views.py`: API endpoints for interacting with the database and performing business logic\n* `templates/index.html`: Main app template\n* `static/styles.css`: Stylesheet for the app\n* `utils.py`: Utility functions for tasks like authentication and data processing\n* `requirements.txt`: Dependencies required by the app\n\n## Starter Code Snippet\n```python\n# app.py\nfrom flask import Flask, render_template\nfrom models import User, Workout\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n# Sample route for the home page\n@app.route(\"/\")\ndef index():\n    # Query the database for all workouts\n    workouts = Workout.query.all()\n    return render_template(\"index.html\", workouts=workouts)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    app.run(debug=True)\n```\nThis snippet sets up a basic Flask app and defines a route for the home page, which queries the database for all workouts and passes them to the template for rendering."}
